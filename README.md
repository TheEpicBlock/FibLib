# My random Fiblib fork
This is a fork of [Fiblib](https://github.com/Hephaestus-Dev/FibLib). It's mostly made for my random project. I removed a bunch of stuff, added some more. I recommend using the upstream version unless your needs match mine exactly.
* Fibs aren't based on dimensions
* Fibs can be updated for individual players using packets
* All Fibbed blocks are stored per dimension, so this isn't very efficient if you plan on having a lot of fibable blocks in one world.
